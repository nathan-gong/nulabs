A.Murphy,Understanding marsh carbon storage,Bowen Lab,,,,,Cellular Analogues,"Molecular level control over membrane surface chemistry allows cells to alter their binding affinity. Cells dynamically control their local molecular density, diffusivity, and membrane elasticity by organizing the ensemble of lipids, sugars, and proteins on their membranes. One model system mimics leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesions by complementing the assembly of molecules on cytokine-activated endothelial cell surfaces.",Bioresponsive Drug Delivery and Tissue Engineering Lab
A.Murphy,Plant Microbe interactions,Bowen Lab,,,,,Bioresponsive Drug Delivery,We investigate the use of stimuli-responsive polymers to alter the release profile of drugs and genetic materials from their carriers. Methods to trigger release can be used to increase the localization of chemotherapeutics within tumors and the efficiency of DNA and siRNA delivery.,Bioresponsive Drug Delivery and Tissue Engineering Lab

Using these data, Center faculty members conducted the first national assessment of community benefits provided by tax-exempt hospitals, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.",Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research
K.McNally,Understanding marsh carbon storage,Bowen Lab,,,,,Pay-for-Performance and Quality of Care,"Center faculty members have conducted studies regarding the design and implementation of pay-for-performance programs for improving quality of care. In support of this research, Center faculty members have received funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research
B.Donnelly,Plant Microbe interactions,Bowen Lab,,,,,Hospital Supply Chain,Center faculty members are conducting studies to identify best practices for managing hospital supply chains and the factors associated with supply chain management as a core competency for hospitals.

S.Scarpino,COVID-19 modeling and wastewater surveillance,Emergent Epidemics Lab,,,,,Opioid Addiction,"Center faculty members are investigating different approaches for treating and reducing the risk of opioid addiction. One study, supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is focusing on physician prescribing practices for opioids including Suboxone, a medication used for treating opioid use disorder. Another study is supported by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at MIT and is evaluating the use of educational messaging and financial incentives for reducing the use and misuse of prescription opioid medication.",Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research
T.Hadzic,COVID-19 modeling and wastewater surveillance,Emergent Epidemics Lab,,,,,Hospital-Physician Integration,"Center faculty members have been conducting research regarding the performance implications for hospitals from employing physicians directly or through practice acquisitions. In a recently completed study, published in the journal Decision Sciences, Center faculty found hospital employment of physicians to be associated with better quality of cardiac care but that the strength of the relationship diminished for hospitals with well-developed service lines for cardiac care as determined in part by patient volumes and advanced information technology.",Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research
D.Joseph,COVID-19 modeling and wastewater surveillance,Emergent Epidemics Lab,,,,,Medicare Quality Ratings,Center faculty members have examined the quality ratings that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services use for prescription drug plans participating in the Medicare Part D program. One such study published in Health Affairs investigated the influence of the socio-economic characteristics of a planís enrollees on its quality ratings for medication adherence.,Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research
C.Yang,COVID-19 modeling and wastewater surveillance,Emergent Epidemics Lab,,,,,Low Value Care,"Center faculty are investigating health care services that offer relatively little value in terms of health benefits. A recently completed project focused on inappropriate diagnostic imaging services, funded by the National Institute for Health Care Management. In this study, center faculty have used the Massachusetts All Payer Database to to examine inappropriate diagnostic imaging based on guidelines from the American College of Radiology.",Center for Health Policy and Healthcare Research
